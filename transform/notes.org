* Candidates for source manipulation
** Package haskell-src
https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskell-src

Straightforward source-to-source transformation.

Main drawback: have to execute the “merging” tool externally.  Bad for
workflow, good enough for proof of concept?

** Template Haskell
http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Template_Haskell

Macro capabilities.  Does not suit our purposes.

1. Cannot extend data type declarations.
2. Have to use extra syntax $() and [| |].

** Language extension?
Can’t find any ressource on writing an extension.

Diving into GHC source is an option left open.

* Using haskell-src
How to add syntax to the parser?
